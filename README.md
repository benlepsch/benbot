#hi
this repo is for my discord bot named benbot

i use python3 and [discord.py rewrite](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite/) ([API](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/api.html)) to make my bot

# usage
to use this bot make a .env file with these values:

`DISCORD_TOKEN, GUILD, PINS_CHANNEL`

Then get poetry ready

```
poetry self add poetry-dotenv-plugin
poetry install
```

then run it

```
poetry run python benbot.py
```
